## Team Projects
      
  * MOAH
    * A platform that people can trade big-data using Ethereum smart contract
    * If buyer posts the amounts of data and it's explanation, the smart contract is created
    * Each data seller can sell their data, and the data is verified by other verifiers.
    * The accuracy of the seller's data and verifier's score is recorded in the contract
    * If all data is collected, the amount of token is given to the sellers and the verifiers according to their accuracy.
    * Data transfer is done with IPFS and the reward is given as a ERC20 token to make decentralized platform.
      * Developed Solidity and Web3.js [link](https://github.com/lackhole/NMT-Project)
